This is sample implementation for the Factory Design pattern.In this pattern,
Shape interface is implemented by different classes like Circle ,Rectangle etc.
Factory class acts as encapsulation to the executor classes and does the logic 
of object creation for executor.

It helps in avoiding object creation scattered across the programming and brings
uncertanity to the code.
